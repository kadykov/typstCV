# Letter to Future Employer

Dear Future Employer,

I'm writing
to offer you
a high-level view
of my career path,
highlighting my expertise
in photonics,
magnetotransport,
high-precision measurements,
and THz technology.

## Photonics & Magnetotransport at L2C & IPM RAS

I began my career in basic research
as a Research Engineer.
<!--  -->
My Ph.D. work,
a collaboration between
Laboratoire Charles Coulomb (L2C)
and the Institute for Physics of Microstructures (IPM RAS),
focused on photonics and magnetotransport
in HgTe/HgCdTe quantum wells.

These heterostructures could serve dual purposes
depending on their configuration:
far-infrared emitters and detectors,
or topological insulators
with protected edge states.
<!--  -->
At IPM RAS,
I studied their potential
as far-infrared emitters and detectors,
using
<!-- Thz and IR -->
photoconductivity and photoluminescence.
<!--  -->
At L2C,
I explored their topological insulator states and transitions,
using THz detection and magnetotransport measurements.

This work led
to the first observation of a topological phase transition
in these heterostructures
by magnetotransport,
as well as record-breaking laser emission wavelengths,
with results published in journals
like Nature Communications, PRL, PRB, and APL.

## High-Precision Measurements at LNE

After completing my Ph.D.,
I moved to applied research
and worked for two years
at the Laboratoire national de métrologie et d'essais (LNE)
as a Research Engineer.
<!--  -->
Here,
I continued to explore magnetotransport properties of 2D systems,
and conducted low-noise,
high-precision
quantum Hall effect measurements in graphene.

My contributions included
automating measurements
using a Python-based orchestration system,
nanofabrication of graphene/hBN stacks,
and optimizing cryogenic measurement systems
to reduce costs
by improving helium recuperation
and implementing a reliable dry helium-free cryogenic system.

## THz Innovation at Multitel ASBL

Next,
I spent over three years
as a Research Engineer at Multitel ASBL,
leading THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS)
and imaging activities.
<!--  -->
There,
I developed THz-based solutions
for industrial applications
such as non-destructive quality control
of humidity, thickness, or composition
<!-- in pharmaceutical, polymer, or biological samples. -->
in industries such as pharmaceuticals, polymers, and biotechnology.

As a result,
I developed new and improved existing methods
for extracting information from THz-TDS data,
including computationally cheap
preliminary estimation of thickness and refractive index
in low-absorption samples
and sensitivity curve-shaped
filtering with enhanced signal-to-noise ratio.

I also implemented infrastructure
for reproducible research,
including Python tools for instrument integration,
FAIR
(findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable)
data management,
and automated data analysis pipelines.

Through this work,
I gained hands-on experience in software development,
including test-driven development,
CI/CD pipeline automation,
and Docker-based containerization.

## What's Next?

I'm now seeking new opportunities
to leverage my skills as a Research Engineer
to contribute to impactful projects.
<!--  -->
Could this be with your team?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
