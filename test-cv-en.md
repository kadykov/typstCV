# Professional experience

## Multitel ASBL {location="Mons \\ Belgium"}

_Non-profit
innovation center specializing in
[applied photonics](https://www.multitel.eu/expertise/applied-photonics/),
[AI](https://www.multitel.eu/expertise/artificial-intelligence/),
etc._

### Research Engineer in THz Spectroscopy and Imaging {dates="Jul.~2021 \\ Aug.~2024"}

Developed
a THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS)
data pipeline
with an improved signal-to-noise ratio
by utilizing sensitivity profile-shaped filtering.

Developed
a computationally cheap
THz-TDS data processing method
for refractive index and thickness extraction
in low-absorption materials.

Streamlined
refractive index profile reconstruction
from THz-TDS data
by offloading calculations
to a GPU
and utilizing backpropagation-based
optimization algorithms.

Implemented
a low-cost operation
and
high spectral quality
broadband THz-TDS setup
by suppressing atmospheric absorption
with silica gel-based dehumidification.

Automated laboratory workflows
by implementing Python tools
for measurement orchestration,
data management,
analysis,
and result presentation.

Ensured best software development practices
by implementing unit testing,
CI/CD pipelines,
and documentation.

Led the
[SAPHIRE](https://www.multitel.eu/projects/saphire/)
project,
developing
non-destructive
_in-situ_ solutions
to control
pill coating thickness
and humidity.

Led the development of
THz-TDS-based methods
for polymer wastes sorting.
