# Active Context: Resolved CI Test Failures (chmod & symlinks) (2025-04-30)

## Current Focus

Verifying CI fixes and completing the task related to switching from submodules to system packages for testing.

## Problem Identified & Resolved

1.  **Initial Problem:** CI tests failed (`bats: not found`) because `actions/checkout@v4` wasn't initializing submodules.
2.  **Intermediate Fix:** Added explicit `git submodule update --init --recursive` to CI.
3.  **New Problem:** The `docker build` step for the *production* image failed with `git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey)`. This occurred because the build context included submodule definitions using SSH URLs, but the build environment lacked SSH keys.
4.  **Root Cause:** The production Docker image build context included `.git` and `tests/` directories. The testing environment (devcontainer) relied on submodules.
5.  **Solution Implemented:**
    *   Switched test dependencies (Bats, Bats-Support, Bats-Assert) from Git submodules to system packages (`apt install`) within the devcontainer (`.devcontainer/Dockerfile.ubuntu`) and for host-run tests (`tests/docker.bats` via CI step).
    *   Created `.dockerignore` to exclude `.git`, `tests/`, and other non-essential files from the production Docker build context, preventing the SSH key error.
    *   Updated Bats test files (`tests/unit/build_sh.bats`, `tests/filter/filters.bats`) to load helpers using `bats_load_library` instead of relative submodule paths.
    *   Updated `justfile` to use the system `bats` executable instead of the submodule path.
    *   Removed the explicit `git submodule update` step from the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
6.  **New Problem (CI):** Tests run inside the devcontainer image (`just test-internal`) failed with `chmod: changing permissions of '/workspaces/typstCV/build.sh': Operation not permitted`.
7.  **Root Cause (CI):** The test script (`tests/unit/build_sh.bats`) attempted to `chmod +x` the `build.sh` script on the host filesystem via the Docker volume mount, which failed due to permissions. Additionally, the symlinks for the local Typst package (`style.typ`, `typst.toml`), created by `postCreateCommand` in the devcontainer, were missing when running the image directly in CI. The host Bats tests (`tests/docker.bats`) were also missing helper packages (`bats-assert`, `bats-support`).
8.  **Solution Implemented (CI):**
    *   Removed the `chmod +x` command from `tests/unit/build_sh.bats`.
    *   Added `RUN` commands to `.devcontainer/Dockerfile.ubuntu` to create the necessary package symlinks during the image build.
    *   Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to install `bats-assert` and `bats-support` on the host runner for the `docker.bats` tests.
9.  **New Problem (CI - Post Fixes):** Tests run inside the devcontainer image (`just test-internal`) failed again, this time with `error: failed to write PDF file (Permission denied (os error 13))`.
10. **Root Cause (CI - Post Fixes):** The test `build.sh: succeeds with valid input file` in `tests/unit/build_sh.bats` was attempting to write the output PDF (`dummy.pdf`) directly into the mounted workspace directory (`/workspaces/typstCV`), which the `vscode` user inside the container didn't have permission to do.
11. **Solution Implemented (CI - Post Fixes):**
    *   Modified the `build.sh: succeeds with valid input file` test in `tests/unit/build_sh.bats` to explicitly write its output PDF to a dedicated subdirectory within the Bats temporary directory (`$BATS_TMPDIR/test_output/`) instead of the current working directory. Added setup/teardown for this directory.

## Recent Actions (This Session)

-   Diagnosed the SSH key failure during `docker build` (previous step).
-   Switched test dependencies to system packages and updated related files (previous step).
-   Diagnosed the subsequent CI failures (`chmod` error, missing symlinks, missing host Bats helpers).
-   Planned the fixes for the CI issues.
-   Modified `.devcontainer/Dockerfile.ubuntu` to add symlink creation (and subsequently removed duplicated commands).
-   Modified `tests/unit/build_sh.bats` to remove `chmod`.
-   Modified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to install Bats helpers on the host runner.
-   Diagnosed the PDF write permission error (`os error 13`) in CI.
-   Modified `tests/unit/build_sh.bats` again to write test output to `$BATS_TMPDIR/test_output/` instead of the CWD.
-   Updated this `activeContext.md`.

## Decisions & Notes

-   Using system packages for test dependencies simplifies the CI build process and avoids SSH key issues during production image builds.
-   `.dockerignore` is crucial for keeping production build contexts clean and secure.
-   `bats_load_library` is the correct way to load system-installed Bats helpers.

## Immediate Next Steps

-   Update `progress.md`.
-   Update `progress.md`.
-   **User Action:** Commit the changes (including the latest update to `tests/unit/build_sh.bats`, `.devcontainer/Dockerfile.ubuntu`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and previous changes like `.dockerignore`, `justfile`, other `.bats` files if not already committed).
-   **User Action:** Trigger the CI workflow and verify all tests pass.
-   **User Action (Optional):** Clean up Git submodule configuration (`.gitmodules`, `git rm --cached tests/bats*`, `rm -rf tests/bats*`).
-   Complete the task.
